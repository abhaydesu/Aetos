## üöÄ Overview

Across research organizations like **DRDO**, technology forecasting often relies on **manual, fragmented methods** ‚Äî from patent searches and publication scans to supplier mapping and TRL assessments.  
These approaches are **time-consuming, siloed, and outdated** before they reach stakeholders.

**AETOS** fixes that by providing an **intelligent, unified dashboard** that continuously aggregates, analyzes, and visualizes technology intelligence in real-time.

## üß† Core Features

### 1. **Technology Convergence Detection**
Identify where disciplines intersect before the world notices.  
- Maps relationships across patents, publications, and companies.  
- Detects emerging intersections (e.g., *AI + Drones*, *Materials + Energy Storage*).  
- Interactive graphs visualize research clustering and co-evolution across domains.  

---

### 2. **TRL Progression & Forecasting**
Track how technologies mature over time.  
- AI-driven **Technology Readiness Level (TRL)** estimation from publications and patents.  
- Real-time S-curve and Hype curve forecasting.  
- Historical and predictive analytics to guide R&D investment timing.  

---

### 3. **Adoption Rate Analytics**
Understand how innovation spreads in the real world.  
- Aggregates **market, funding, and industry signals** to estimate adoption velocity.  
- Highlights **public vs private R&D investments** by sector.  
- Dynamic dashboards showing market size evolution and convergence trends.

## üîó Data Integration

AETOS connects and harmonizes multiple data sources:  
- **Google Patents API** ‚Äî Patent filings and inventor trends.  
- **arXiv API** ‚Äî Research papers, abstracts, and citations.  
- **Industry Reports (custom feeds)** ‚Äî Market size, company engagement, and funding data.  
- **Simulated modules** for demo visualization (for non-public data).
